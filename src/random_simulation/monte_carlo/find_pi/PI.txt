Area of circle: PI * R * R
Area of Square: (2R) * (2R) = 4 * R * R
PI = 4 * Circle Area / Square Area

Put a point randomly on the picture.
If the put a lot of points, the number of points can approximate
the area of square and the area of circle.
If the point is in the area of circle, we use red;
If the point is in the area of square outside the circle, we use green.

Then, PI = 4 * number of red points / total number of points .
